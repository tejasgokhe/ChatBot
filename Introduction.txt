🔹 What is C++?

C++ is a general-purpose programming language used for system programming, application development, game development, embedded systems, and more. It combines:

Procedural programming (like C)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Generic programming (using templates)

🔹 Key Features of C++

Object-Oriented Programming

Classes and Objects

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Encapsulation

Abstraction

Fast and Efficient

Direct memory management

High performance

Portability

Programs can run on different platforms with minimal changes

Standard Template Library (STL)

Provides ready-made data structures like vectors, stacks, queues, maps, etc.

Low-Level Memory Access

Supports pointers and dynamic memory allocation

🔹 Why Learn C++?

Widely used in competitive programming

Strong foundation for Data Structures & Algorithms

Used in game engines and system software

Helpful for placement preparation

Popular software developed using C++ includes:

Adobe Photoshop

Google Chrome

Counter-Strike

🔹 Basic Structure of a C++ Program
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}


Explanation:

#include <iostream> → Used for input and output

using namespace std; → Allows use of standard library

int main() → Entry point of the program

cout → Used to print output

return 0; → Indicates successful execution

🔹 Applications of C++

Operating Systems

Game Development

Embedded Systems

Desktop Applications

Banking & Financial Systems

🔹 Conclusion

C++ is a versatile and powerful programming language that provides both high-level and low-level programming features. It remains one of the most important languages for software development and campus placement preparation.
